This plugin will sanitize input CSS for an ActiveRecord model.  It defaults to using the +custom_css+ attribute.

1. Include the +CssSantize+ module in your ActiveRecord model.
2. Use +YourModel.custom_css=+ to set the css.
3. No step three.

Optionally, you can just use the sanitizer directly by calling the +sanitize_css+ method.
